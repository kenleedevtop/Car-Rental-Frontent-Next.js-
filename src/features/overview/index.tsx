              The upcoming Jarun Lake Residential House project will be built on
              a plot of land with a cadaster number of 44605:001:1020. The total
              area of the land is 10 hectares, out of which 8.2 hectares have
              been approved for detailed planning as living area. The project
              will include 30 single houses and 4 terraced houses, and the land
              has already been pre-divided into separate plots. The development
              of this massive project will be carried out in 4 separate stages.
            </OverviewTextContent>
            <OverviewTextContent>
              The first stage of the project involves the construction of 7
              single houses. Each house will be built on a separate plot of land
              measuring approximately 1600 m2. The houses will have a total area
              ranging from 150 to 200 m2. Currently, a high-voltage line runs
              along the edge of the land, but it will be moved within the next
              6-8 months according to a signed agreement with the electricity
              network.
